  Changes:
    - Major overhaul of code.
    - Instead of carrying one of each items, you get blueprints of placeable structures. There are some exceptions, like power poles and underground pipes (but not underground belts, as these cause issues). These exceptions exist to improve the game experience, such as placing power poles at max distance.
    - Scenario now provides an "Upgrade Planner". In the deconstruction planner, place items you're upgrading from on the second row, and items you're upgrading to on third row, directly below. See mod page for more details.
